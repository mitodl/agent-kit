"""Pi adapter: no "type" field on MCP entries — stdio and remote servers share
one shape distinguished by presence of "command" vs "url" (see
adapters/_wire/pi_mcp.py).

Skills install only to Pi's own skills dir (~/.pi/agent/skills/), not also to
the shared cross-agent pool (~/.agents/skills/): Pi already natively unions
both directories when discovering skills (its own docs.md "Locations"
section), so writing the same skill into both is pure duplication — Pi finds
the name twice and logs a spurious "skill collision" warning on every
startup. A single dest dir is correct and sufficient.
