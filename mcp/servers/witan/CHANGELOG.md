# Changelog

All notable changes to `witan-council` are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0:
a MINOR bump may include breaking changes).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **`witan --version`**: prints the installed package version, appending a
  git short ref when installed editable (local workspace) or directly from
  a VCS URL (`uvx --from git+...`), via the new
  `agent_config_kit.resolve_version()` helper.

### Changed

- `agent-config-kit` dependency bumped to `>=0.4,<1` (was `>=0.1,<1`) to
  require the version that ships `resolve_version`, which backs the new
  `--version` flag.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-09

Initial PyPI release. `witan` is the umbrella CLI and MCP server for the
team-wide work-coordination graph: `memory_*` (patterns, project facts,
lessons, agent context, with BM25 + graph-expansion recall), `task_*`
(work-coordination graph with dependencies and claiming), and `workflow_*`
(cross-session project/session tracking). Covers `witan serve` (the MCP
server), `witan tasks`/`witan memory`/`witan project`/`witan trace` CLI
commands, `witan scan`/`witan migrate` graph maintenance, session hooks, and
mounting `witan-code` as `witan code …` when it's installed alongside it.
